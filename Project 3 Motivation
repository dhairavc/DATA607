William Edwards Deming is known for the quote “In God we trust, all others must bring data.” It is clear that data-driven decision making is superior and is in these times a requirement to maintain a competitive edge. Every industry now treats their data as an asset to get insights from and is a foundation in the decision making process. Turning data into insights not only requires appropriate systems in place, but also requires the appropriate subject matter experts to interpret and discover what the data has to say.

Data Science is the art of analyzing data to gain knowledge in order to make business decisions. Data Science at its core is a union of mathematics, statistics, and programming disciplines. Data Scientists need to possess various skills such as data/quantitative analysis, R/Python programming, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, etc. Some skills may be more important than others depending on the task at hand. 

As future Data Scientists we seek to understand what are some of the most important skills to possess. We will gather this consensus by conducting exploratory analysis on what skills employers are looking for through job listings on LinkedIn and Indeed.
